<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
As a Chemistry undergraduate at Oxford, time is at a premium. Given a list of chemicals and their respective hazard codes, AutoCOSHH performs all of the menial work involved in generating a COSHH form. The built-in reference sheet specifies many of the most commonly used solvents and chemicals. The `latexmkrc` module is used to generate the COSHH form in the required format.

<h3>FEATURES</h3>
<ul> 
    <li>Generate hundred-page long COSHH forms in seconds</li>
    <li>Randomise display order of chemicals</li>
    <li>Specify mass, concentration, volume and other parameters in brackets</li>
    <li>Automatates 'Specific Safety or Risk Implication' section</li>
    <li>Many commonly used solvents and chemicals already specified</li>
</ul>
