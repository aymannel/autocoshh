<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
As a Chemistry undergraduate at Oxford, time is at a premium. Given a list of chemicals and their respective hazard codes, AutoCOSHH performs all of the menial work involved in generating a COSHH form. The built-in reference sheet specifies many of the most commonly used solvents and chemicals. The `latexmkrc` module is used to generate the COSHH form in the required format.
