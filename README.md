# AutoCOSHH

## DESCRIPTION
AutoCOSHH is an application that attempts to eliminate the menial work involved in manually generating COSHH forms. Given a list of chemicals and their respective hazard codes, AutoCOSHH performs the logic that relates a given hazard code to its associated hazards, exposure routes and control measures. These relationships are defined in a local SQL database. The latexmk package is then used to compile a clean COSHH form in the required format (see images below).


## FEATURES

* Generate hundred-page long COSHH forms in seconds
* Specify mass, concentration, volume and other details after a double backslash
* Automatates 'Specific Safety or Risk Implication' section
* Large number of commonly used solvents and chemicals already specified
* Easily add missing chemicals and their respective hazard codes to `reference.csv`
* Randomise display order of chemicals
